This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects in Java and Kotlin Android development.

## What is this website for?

This website serves as my online resume and portfolio, providing information about my background, skills, projects, and ways to connect with me. It's intended for:

* **Potential Employers and Recruiters:** To easily understand my technical abilities and experience.
* **Networking:** To provide a central hub for my professional online presence.
* **Personal Branding:** To showcase my passion for Android and mobile development.

## Key Features

* **Homepage:** Introduction with a professional overview and key skills.
* **About Me:** Detailed information about my education, experiences, and aspirations.
* **Projects:** A showcase of my Android development projects (to be added), highlighting the problem, technologies used, and my role.
* **Contact:** My contact information (phone and email) and potentially a contact form.
* **Links:** Direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
* **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to look and function well on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
* **Modern and Professional Design:** A clean and user-friendly interface to create a positive impression.

## Technology Stack (Planned)

This project is planned to be built using one of the following technology stacks:

**Option A (Java-focused):**

* **Backend (Optional):** Spring Boot (for potential future API needs, like a contact form).
* **Frontend:**
    * Thymeleaf (for server-side rendering)
    * **OR** React/Vue.js (for a more interactive SPA, potentially with a Spring Boot backend).
* **Database (Optional):** H2, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (if a backend with data persistence is implemented).

**Option B (Kotlin-focused):**

* **Backend (Optional):** Ktor (for building asynchronous web applications).
* **Frontend:**
    * Kotlin HTML DSL (for server-side HTML generation)
    * **OR** React/Vue.js (for a dynamic frontend with a Ktor backend).
* **Database (Optional):** Exposed, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (if a backend with data persistence is implemented).

**Note:** The specific technologies used will be finalized during the development process.

## Project Structure (Planned)

The project structure will depend on the chosen technology stack. However, it will generally follow best practices for organizing backend and frontend code separately (if a full-stack approach is taken).
